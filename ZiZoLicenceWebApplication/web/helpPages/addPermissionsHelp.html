    <h4 id = "helpSubtitles">Description:</h4>
    <p id = "helpParagraphs">This page is used to add permissions (allowances) for the selected user. This can include allowances such as the ability 
    to view Administrator Logs to the ability to change the passwords of users.</p>
    <h4 id = "helpSubtitles">Username Textbox:</h4>
    <p id = "helpParagraphs">The Username textbox is where you must enter the name of the user you are adding a permission for. Note, if there is an
     error when typing the name, or the user does not exist on the server, the permission will not be created. So take care when typing the name.</p>
    <h4 id = "helpSubtitles">Permissions Drop Down Box:</h4>
    <p id = "helpParagraphs">This drop down box is what is used to select the permission you wish to attatch to the user. You can add as many permissions
     as you want to a specified user, but it must be done one at a time.</p>
    <h4 id = "helpSubtitles">Add Permissions Button:</h4>
    <p id = "helpParagraphs">Once the user and permission has been selected, click the button to send a request to the server to add the permission for the 
     user.</p>
