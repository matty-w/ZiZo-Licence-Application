    <p id = "helpParagraphs">This page is used for the sole purpose of adding a user to the Licence Server. This user will be created
     without any permissions, and must be added seperately.</p>
    <h4 id = "helpSubtitles">Username Textbox:</h4>
    <p id = "helpParagraphs">The Username textbox is where you must type the name of the new user that you are adding. It is highly recommended that the
     user being created is in the form of an email address (E.g. example@name.co.uk).</p>
    <h4 id = "helpSubtitles">Password Textbox:</h4>
    <p id = "helpParagraphs">The Password textbox is where you must type the password for the user you are creating. Remember to set the password as
     something memorable, so as to not be locked out of the account due to forgetting the password.</p>  
    <h4 id = "helpSubtitles">Confirm Password Textbox:</h4>
    <p id = "helpParagraphs">This textbox is simply used to confirm you have indeed created the password you have intended to. The user must re type
     the password they have created in the original 'Password Textbox' to verify the password is correct. The form will not proceed until both the
     'Password Textbox' and 'Confirm Password Textbox' match.</p>
    <h4 id = "helpSubtitles">Add User Button:</h4>
    <p id = "helpParagraphs">Once all of the required fields are filled correctly. Click this button to send a request to create the new user.</p>
